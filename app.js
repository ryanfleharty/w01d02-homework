// 1. Interpolation is inserting values of variables into
// strings to use for console logs.by using `` and ${}.
// const hello = "hello world!";
//
// console.log(`I am thrilled to be around here ${hello}`);
//
//  While Concatenation
// is using strings together with variables.
// const firstName = "Ben";
// const lastName = "wall";
// console.log("Welcome back " + firstName + lastName);


// 2. DRY stands for don't repeat yourself. which is mainly
// to have optimized and clean code so other coders will be
// able to read and understand what you're trying to do.
// Instead of using a While loops for every function. There is
// the For loops which can cut down on code to run faster.


// 3. Defining a variable is declaring it for the first time.
// these will be defined with an initial value to that variable.
// which can be a string or a number.

// 4. A const is used when the value of the variable will not change.
// While it can be modified using that const's name with .push.
// Let is another way of declaring a variable but it's value can be changed
// when it is mentioned throughout the code.

// 5. A parent directory is the directory or folder that hosts other files within its path.
// that can consist of the main project folder being the parent directory
// of the index, css and javascript files for creating a website.

// 6. Within the terminal you can use the command "man" before the command's name
// to have a manual description of what the possibilities of the command holds, along
// with its purpose.

// 7. Tab completion is used to help the user within the terminal to auto fill
// the rest of the object. It streamlines the workflow for going through directories.
// Along with skipping over spelling mistakes that could happen if it was typed.


// 1. a < b
// 2. c > d
// 3. 'name' = 'name'
// 4. a < b < c
// 5. a = a < d
// 6. e = 'Kevin'
// 7. 48 = '48'


// 1. It's not an infinite loop because there is nothing to check for the loop to repeat.
//
//
// 2. it is  an infinite loop because it only loops while runProgram remains true.
// But within the function it will return false but that is within the function staying locally
// in the function and will not change the initial value of runProgram keeping it in a loop.

//3.
// established variable letters with the string A
// let letters = "A";
// // established the variable i with the value of 0
// let i = 0;
// // starts a loop for when i is less than 20 run the loop.
//
// while (i < 20) {
//   // add A to the variable A
// 	letters += "A";
//   // Continue to run the loop until while is complete.
// 	i++;
// }
// // logs the letter A infinitely
// console.log(letters);





// 1. The difference between for and while loops is how the loop is conducted.
// For loops have less code and have the loop within the initial (). Which can keep
// going on infinitely if it isn't written right. while the while
// loops have more code underneath them for returns and work until it's finished.

2. for (let i = 0; i <= 999; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

3.
// defining i as a variable with 0 as its value.
// until i = 100
// continue until previous are false.
 for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
	console.log('Without you, today\'s emotions are the scurf of yesterday\'s');
}



4. for (let i = 999; i < 0; i--) {
  console.log(i);
}




5. for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(`the value of i is: ${i} of 10`);
}
