//1. What is the difference between interpolation and concatenation? Give an example of each.
//interpolation is when a string is inserted into an existing string via ${ref}
//concatenation is appending strings together and converting into strings.

//2. What does the acronym DRY stand for? Why should we pay attention to it? What programming tools have we learned to write DRY code?
//DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself".
//Following DRY standards will result in easier to read, execute, and maintain code.
//loops (and functions) help us to write DRY code by allowing us to call the same code again in multiple places

//3. What is the difference between declaring a variable and assigning a value to a variable? What do we mean when we say "define" a variable?

//4. When should we use const and when should we use let?

//5. Unix question: What is a "parent" directory?

//6. Unix, again: If you're not sure about how to use a Unix command, how can you get more info without being connected to the internet?
//Use the "man" command to access the manual in the terminal or just type the command without any parameters or -flags

//7. More Unix: What is "tab completion" and why is it awesome?
//Its when you start typing a word in the terminal (or in your text editor) and hit tab and it auto-suggests a correct "completion" of that word to a variable or function call or directory name, etc.
