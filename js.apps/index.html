//The differance between interpolation and concatention...
//Interpolation: inserts values of variables into strings
//concatention: Adds strings together.


//Acronym DRY: don't repeat yourself.


//What does the differance between declaring a variable and //assigning a value to a variable?
//A variable can be declared only once and is used to help avoid 
//mistakes such as assigning string values.
//Declaring a variable by giving it a value type so that its ready
//to use

//What do we mean when we say "define" a variable? 
// The ability to test a value and its relationships.


//When should we use (const) and when should we use (let)?
// (const) is used as a default and if a change needs to be 
//made (let) is used.

//Unix question: What is a "parent" directory?
//A folder that is one level up from the current directory
//in a file hierarchy

//Unix, again: If you're not sure about how to use Unix command,
//how can you get more info without being on the internet?
// Typing in the commands in the terminal like ls,mv,cp etc.

//What is "tab completion" and why is it aweseome?
//Just hit Tab while typing a command, option, or file name and //the shell environment will automatically complete what youâ€™re //typing or suggest options to you.


//a = b;  false
//c = d;  false
//'Name' __ 'Name';  true
//a __ b __ c;  false
//a __ a __ d; false
//e __ 'Kevin';  true
//48 __ '48';  false


//Is this an infinite loop? Why or why not?

//while (true) {
//	console.log('Do not run this loop');
//} Yes, unknown variable.


//Is the following loop an infinite loop? Why or why not?

//const runProgram = true;

//while (runProgram) {
	//console.log('Do not run this loop');
	//runProgram = false;
//}

//Inifnite or not infinite? What is the expected output?
//No it's not infinite. The variable states it to be true.


//Without running this loop, what is the expected output?

//let letters = "A";
let i = 0;

while (i < 20) { it will count till 20  
	letters += "A";
	i++;
}

console.log(letters);

//After coming to a conclusion, run the code and write down //whether it gave you the expected result. If not, how did it //differ?
// The conclusion was AAAAAA on one line, my result was I thought 
// it would be stacked.


//for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
	console.log('Without you, today\'s emotions are the scurf of yesterday\'s');
}
//The first part of the control statement is: executed one time //before the execution of the code block.

//The second part of the control statement is: defines the //condition for executing the code block.

//The third part of the control statement is: executed every //time after the code block has been executed.


//Using a postfix operator i-- instead of i++, write a for loop that iterates in reverse: console.log() a countdown from 999 to 0.

//for (let i = 999; i > 0; i--) {
	console.log('end of the line')
}

//Write a for loop that uses interpolation to print a message to // the console that includes the current value of i.


//for(let i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
    console.log('the number is: ' + i);
